<!--Adds special disease, including Creutzfeldt-Rim Disease

Standard information to keep in mind for vanilla disease:

	T_D (Tending difficulty is minimum q so that immunity catches up: n = i*s + t*q. q = (n-i*s)/t
	N_C (natural course or time to death untreated) = 1/n
	I_F (how much each increment by 1 of immunity gain speed affects tending difficulty) = dq/ds = -i/t

	s = immunity gain speed (assumed 1)
	q = average tending quality (assume = tending difficulty, T_D). 

	n = severity not immune per day = 1/N_C
	i = immunity per day = (n - t*q)/s = 1/N_C - t*T_D = 1/N_C + i*T_D/I_F = 1/N_C / (1 + T_D/I_F)
	t = severity tended per day = -i/I_F
	
	Creutzfeldt-Rim Disease: N_C = 60-180

		<description>Creutzfeldt-Rim Disease is a variant of the prion-mediated Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease that occurs spontaneously at much higher rates on the Rim without seeming explantion. While these misfolded proteins are almost invariably deadly and are devilishly difficult to dispose of safely, these are constrained to the brain, so is only spread via cannibalism. This disease begins asymptomatic and hidden, possibly for years, before rapidly destroying its host's central nervous system, resulting in frequent mental breaks and inevitable death. This disease affects a protein highly specific to the human brain, and is no danger to non-humans or most genetically-modified humans</description>
