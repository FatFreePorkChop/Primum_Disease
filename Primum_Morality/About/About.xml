		Stages:
			A: in process of implementing
			B: implemented, needs testing
			C: finished
			
			?: Possible future addition
			
			
			Some actions are moral, some aspects (memes, structures, or precepts) are also moral. Things where it's hard to keep track of each action may also be moral or immoral.
			Moral things are assigned a category: eg. butchering a human, eating human flesh, and the cannibal meme all fall under MoralityCategory Cannibalism
			Every so often, adjust morality based on actions taken over the time period. Default time period is quadrum. Morality Ranges from 0 to 100. Morality can change by up to 0.6/year up
				Calculation starts at 50. If you took a relevant evil action with Count 1, Bad magnitude -25, result would be 25. If initial morality were 80 last quadrum, new morality would be 0.65
			Morality has 3 modes, set in options
				Universal morality: framework is independant of other factions' ideologies: even a cannibal faction will think your human leather hats are evil.
				Conglomerate morality: frammework is determiend based on the average of other factions' ideologies: if everyone else is cannibal, cannibalism is probably  okay.
				Individual morality: framework is faction-specific, according to their individual precepts.
			
			Morality tiers:
				0-5: Vile
				5-20: Wicked
				20-40: Unprincipled
				40-60: Inoffensive
				60-80: Principled
				80-95: Honorable
				95-100: Blameless
			
			
			Actions and aspects properties
				Category (eg. cannibalism for human butchery, cannibal meme, and eating human flesh)
				Weight (how much that aspect or meme contributes; total weight is scaled so that total weight asymptotically approaches 2)
				ScaleWithColonists (if true, weight will be divided by total number of colonists)
			Category properties
				Positive magnitude (how much the category affects morality if other factions like it. Magnitude is per year, so if recalcultaion is done per quadrum, magnitude should be divided by 4)
				Negative magnitude (as above, but if other factions dislike it)
				Relevance (Some actions are much more clearly moral than others: nudity is only evil to anti-nude factions with high bigotry, ranges from 0 to 5. Diversity of thought is added to this)
				Positive memes (if other factions are cannibal, they won't mind that you're also cannibal. If a faction has both the positive and negative memes, the category will be negative)
				Negative memes 
				Default state ("Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral")
