Consider standardizing more stuff. In vanilla, nuclear stomach causes cancer/120 days, smokeleaf every 180-130 days, toxic buildup 111 days

		Should:
			Add new diseases
			Adjust old disease

		Makes surgery behave more reasonably
			If you have a surgery that requires 13 skill, then a surgeon with 20 skill should be way better at in than a surgeon with 13.
			
			Cleanliness (c): varies from ~-10 to 0.6
				C = 0.6 +(0.9 * (c+5)/10), in range [0.6, 1.5]
				At cleanliness 0.6, this factor is 1.1
			Medical potency (M): varies from 70% to 130%--scaled from 0% to 200%. 0->70, 70->91, 100->100, 160->118
			Doctor's success factor (d) varies from 0.05 to 1.1 at skill 0 to 20. Additionally influenced by traits, surgery success chance, etc.
				D = d (~ 0.00017x^3-0.00820x^2+0.14916x+0.04301)
			Bed success chance factor (B) varies from 0.9 (awful bed) to 1.48 (legendary medical bed with vitals monitor)
			
			Default formula
				P(success) = C*M*D*B
			New formula
				P(success) = (C*M*B*D*E)^(1/2). Scaled to min(P, 0.95 + (P-0.95)/5)
					Surgery success chance factor is a multiplier on E, which has a higher weight!
					Geometric mean, with E having extra weightMakes it regress toward the lowest factor
					If P>0.95, P = 0.95 + (P-0.95)/5. 
					If
					
					That last 5% success rate is hard to get.
					Note that in the code, B and C are mixed together. B and C also include Cleanliness is still a factor!
				D adjusted to not depend on doctor's skill. Examples include: Inspiration = 2, also increases effective skill by 4 for E calculation, Mad surgeon (VTE) = 1.2, and Medical specialist (ideology) = 1.5. Only dependent on traits, inspiration, etc. This is accomplishd by a patch to stats_pawns_workmedical
				E is max(1,0.4+0.6*(SurplusSkill/5))
